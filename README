Description:
This application is a JavaScript translation of a Python TensorFlow tutorial created by Morvan Zhou.
It implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate "artistic paintings" based on random input.
A real painting is defined as a smooth curve that is inside the lower and upper bounds.
After some training a generated painting should look close to a smooth curve inside the bounds.
The application will automatically start training the GAN.
You will see one example of generated artwork displayed in real-time, along with the discriminator's score and accuracy.

Original Python Code:
For reference, the original Python code can be found at:

Installation:
1. Open the 'index.html' file in your web browser.

Files:
- index.html: The main HTML file to run the application. It contains a canvas for displaying generated art and text fields for showing the discriminator's score and accuracy.
- tensorflow.js: The JavaScript file containing the GAN implementation.

Parameters to change in the javascript file:
- EPOCHS: Number of epochs for training (default: 5000)
- BATCH_SIZE: Size of batches used for training (default: 64)
- LR_G: Learning rate for the generator (default: 0.0001)
- LR_D: Learning rate for the discriminator (default: 0.0001)
- N_IDEAS: Number of random input ideas for generating art (default: 5)
- ART_COMPONENTS: Number of points the generator can draw (default: 15)
